## Add new SSH key
On the main Navigation Panel go to `Cloud` and choose `SSH Keys`. On this page you find all added SSH Keys with their details area.

**SSH key details area includes:** 

`SSH key name`: Shows the name for the key so that you can more easily identify it.  

`Creation date`: Shows when a SSH key was created in month-day-year format.  
`Fingerprint`: Shows each Public Key fingerprint which is a sequence of bytes used to identify a longer public key. Fingerprints are created by applying a cryptographic hash function to a Public Key.

On the next page fill next fields:  

`Name`: in this field you will set a name for the key, so you can identify it easier.

After filling the specified fields hit **Save Key** and a new SSH key will be added.

If you are prompted with the following message **Your form contains errors**, when trying to add a new SSH key, you have to check: 

`Name`, as there might be some unsafe characters() used. 

`Key Content`, as the SSH public key added might be invalid.
