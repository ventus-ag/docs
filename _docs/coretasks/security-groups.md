## What is Security Group
**A security group** is a named collection of network access rules that are use to limit the types of traffic that have access to instances. When you launch an instance, you can assign one or more security groups to it. If you do not create security groups, new instances are automatically assigned to the default security group named `fleio`, unless you explicitly specify a different security group.

The associated rules in each security group control the traffic to instances in the group. Any incoming traffic that is not matched by a rule is denied access by default. You can add rules to or remove rules from a security group, and you can modify rules for the default and any other security group.

To find *Security Group page* in Ventus Cloud Portal you need on the main Navigation Panel to go to `Cloud` and choose `Security Group`. When you access this page a list of existing security groups with their details area are displayed in card or list format:

*list format:*

Clicking on a security group box will take you to a security group details page, where you can see details for a security group, all the rules belonging to that group and associated instances:
