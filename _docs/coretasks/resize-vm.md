One of the great benefits of Ventus VMs is the ability to change the size of your VM based on the needs for CPU, Network, disk or memory requirements. 

**To resize the current instance:**  
- go to Instances page, choose instance, which size you want to change (eg. "Test 1" which flavor is VC-2)

- choose new flavor of instance you need and click `resize instance`

- confirm the resizing - click `resize instance` again

- wait until resize completed, login to your instance and confirm that the server is operational after resizing

- choose `Cofirm resize` from the instanse menu to confirm migration was successful, otherwise choose `Revert resize` to revert back to the initial state.
