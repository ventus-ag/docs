## NTP servers with 'monlist' enabled - port 123  
---
**Defenition:**      
**The Network Time Protocol (NTP)** is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between IT systems. NTP supports a monitoring service that allows administrators to query the server for traffic counts of connected clients via the 'monlist' command.

**Problem:**   
The NTP 'monlist' feature can be abused for DDoS reflection attacks against third parties.

**Verification:**   
In this section, we show how to check a host for an openly accessible service. All tests are performed using tools commonly included with standard Linux/Unix distributions. To verify the service is openly accessible from the Internet, the test should not be run on the host itself or the local network but instead from a different node on the Internet, for example a host on a cable/DSL line. In all examples, replace 000.000.00.00 with the IP address of the host to check.

To check if an NTP server is openly accessible from the Internet and has the 'monlist' feature enabled, you can use 'ntpdc' like this:
```
# ntpdc -n -c monlist 000.000.00.00
```

An NTP server with the 'monlist' feature enabled will return a list of clients that recently queried the NTP server:
```console
remote address          port local address      count m ver rstr avgint  lstint
===============================================================================
123.56.67.89             123 000.000.00.00       3559 4 4      0    446     119
34.56.78.90              123 000.000.00.00      16992 4 4      0    137     207
98.76.54.32              123 000.000.00.00      17005 4 4      0    137     232
111.22.33.44           58708 000.000.00.00          3 3 4      0 423826   72192
222.33.44.55           35560 000.000.00.00          8 3 4      0 180029  236607
33.44.55.66            59053 000.000.00.00          1 3 3      0 615565  615565
44.55.66.77            59040 000.000.00.00          2 3 4      0 637297  664374
```

If the list of clients is currently empty, it will instead return:
```console
***Server reports data not found
```

If there is no openly accessible NTP server with the 'monlist' feature enabled, the request will run into a timeout: Timeout:
```console
000.000.00.00: timed out, nothing received
***Request timed out
```

**Solution:**     
Update to ntpd version 4.2.7p26 or later. If an update is not possible, disable status queries in the NTP server's configuration or restrict access to trusted clients.

## DNS Open-resolver - port 53    
---
**Defenition:**      
**DNS Open-resolvers** are DNS servers responding to recursive queries for arbitrary domain names from anywhere on the Internet.

**Problem:**  
DNS Open-resolvers can be abused for DDoS reflection attacks against third parties.

**Verification:**  
In this section, we show how to check a host for an openly accessible service. All tests are performed using tools commonly included with standard Linux/Unix distributions. To verify the service is openly accessible from the Internet, the test should not be run on the host itself or the local network but instead from a different node on the Internet, for example a host on a cable/DSL line. In all examples, replace 000.000.00.00 with the IP address of the host to check.

To check if a DNS server is configured as an open resolver allowing recursive queries, you can use the 'dig' tool for sending a DNS request for an arbitrary domain name (the server is not authoritative for) to the IP address of the DNS server in question:
```
$ dig cert-bund.de @000.000.00.00
```

An open resolver allowing recursive queries will return a response like this, followed by a set of DNS records:
```console
; <<>> DiG 9.8.1-P1 <<>> cert-bund.de @000.000.00.00
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 43941
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0
```

A DNS server not allowing recursive queries will instead respond with an error message like this:
```console
; <<>> DiG 9.8.1-P1 <<>> cert-bund.de @000.000.00.00
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: REFUSED, id: 42022
;; flags: qr rd; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0
;; WARNING: recursion requested but not available
```

**Solution:**     
Disable recursion or limit recursion to trusted clients in the DNS server's configuration.
For instructions how to disable/limit recursion with other DNS servers, please consult the manual.

## Openly accessible Multicast DNS (mDNS) services - port 5353  
---
**Defenition:**      
**Multicast DNS (mDNS)** is used for resolving host names to IP addresses within small networks that do not include a local DNS server. It is implemented e. g. by the Apple 'Bonjour' and Linux/BSD 'Avahi' (nss-mdns) services. mDNS uses port **5353/udp**.

**Problem:**   
Openly accessible mDNS services can be abused for DDoS reflection attacks against third parties. Furthermore, they allow potential attackers to gather information on the system or network the service is running on for preparation of further attacks.

**Verification:**   
In this section, we show how to check a host for an openly accessible service. All tests are performed using tools commonly included with standard Linux/Unix distributions. To verify the service is openly accessible from the Internet, the test should not be run on the host itself or the local network but instead from a different node on the Internet, for example a host on a cable/DSL line. In all examples, replace 000.000.00.00 with the IP address of the host to check.

To check if an mDNS service is openly accessible from the Internet, the 'dig' tool can be used like this:
```
$ dig +short -p 5353 -t ptr _services._dns-sd._udp.local @000.000.00.00
```

An openly accessible mDNS service will return a response like this:
```console
_workstation._tcp.local.
_udisks-ssh._tcp.local.
```

Otherwise, the request will run into a timeout:
```console
;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached
```

**Solution:**   
If the mDNS service is not required, disable or deinstall it. Otherwise, restrict access to trusted clients, for example by blocking incoming connections to port **5353/udp** on the firewall.

On Debian/Ubuntu based Linux systems, the mDNS service can be removed using the following command:
```
# apt-get remove avahi-daemon
```

## Openly accessible SSDP servers - port 1900  
---
**Defenition:**      
**The Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP)** is a network protocol for advertisement and discovery of network services and presence information. SSDP is the basis of the discovery protocol of Universal Plug and Play (UPnP). SSDP uses port **1900/udp**.

**Problem:**     
Openly accessible SSDP servers can be abused for DDoS reflection attacks against third parties.

**Verification:**    
In this section, we show how to check a host for an openly accessible service. All tests are performed using tools commonly included with standard Linux/Unix distributions. To verify the service is openly accessible from the Internet, the test should not be run on the host itself or the local network but instead from a different node on the Internet, for example a host on a cable/DSL line. In all examples, replace 000.000.00.00 with the IP address of the host to check.

To check if an SSDP server is openly accessible from the Internet, run 'tcpdump' in a first terminal:
```
# tcpdump -n -A host 000.000.00.00
```

Then, in a second terminal, use the Bash shell to send an SSDP request:
```console
$ perl -e 'print "M-SEARCH * HTTP/1.1\r\nHost:239.255.255.250:1900\r\n
ST:upnp:rootdevice\r\nMan:\"ssdp:discover\"\r\nMX:3\r\n\r\n"'
> /dev/udp/000.000.00.00/1900
```

If the SSDP server is openly accessible from the Internet, you will see a response like this in the first terminal:
```console
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Location: http://000.000.00.00:32469/DeviceDescription.xml
Cache-Control: max-age=1800
Server: UPnP/1.0 DLNADOC/1.50 Platinum/1.0.4.11
EXT: 
USN: uuid:abcdb3c3-eada-b308-2e21-6edbab9cf4ed::upnp:rootdevice
ST: upnp:rootdevice
Date: Fri, 01 Apr 2016 11:15:08 GMT
```

**Solution:**   
If the SSDP server is not required, disable or deinstall it. Otherwise, restrict access to trusted clients, for example by blocking incoming connections to port **1900/udp** on the firewall.

## Openly accessible SNMP servers - port 161  
---
**Defenition:**      
**The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)** is a networking protocol for device management and monitoring.

**Problem:**    
Openly accessible SNMP servers using the default 'public' community can be abused for DDoS reflection attacks against third parties. Furthermore, they allow potential attackers to gather information on the server or network for preparation of further attacks.

**Verification:**    
In this section, we show how to check a host for an openly accessible service. All tests are performed using tools commonly included with standard Linux/Unix distributions. To verify the service is openly accessible from the Internet, the test should not be run on the host itself or the local network but instead from a different node on the Internet, for example a host on a cable/DSL line. In all examples, replace 000.000.00.00 with the IP address of the host to check.

To check if an SNMP server is openly accessible from the Internet, you can use the 'snmpget' tool:
```
$ snmpget -c public -v 2c 000.000.00.00 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0
```

An openly accessible SNMP server will return a 'System Description' string like this:
```console
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0 =
STRING: "Linux easy.box 2.6.32.32 #1 Fri Jun 12 11:16:35 CST 2015 mips"
```

Otherwise, snmpget will run into a timeout:
```console
Timeout: No Response from 000.000.00.00.
```

**Solution:**    
Configure a 'private' community with mandatory authentication instead of using the default 'public' community. Restrict access to the SNMP server to trusted clients in the server's configuration and/or by blocking incoming connections to port **161/udp** on the firewall.

**Further Information:**

## Openly accessible Telnet servers - port 23  
---
**Defenition:**      
**Telnet** is an outdated network protocol for text-oriented command-line access to remote hosts.

**Problem:**   
With Telnet, all communication including username and password is transmitted unencrypted in clear text and is therefore susceptible to eavesdropping.

Many IoT devices (routers, network cameras, etc.) are running Telnet servers by default. If the devices are openly accessible from the Internet and standard login credentials have not been changed, an attacker can easily gain full control of the devices. Malware like Mirai automatically exploits insecure Telnet servers openly accessible from the Internet using to compromise devices and connect them to a botnet.

**Solution:**    
If the Telnet server is not required, disable or deinstall it. Otherwise, restrict access to trusted local networks. In particular for IoT devices: Check if default login credentials have been changed.

We recommends using (Open)SSH with key-based authentication for secure access to remote hosts.

## Openly accessible LDAP servers - port 389  
---
**Defenition:**      
**The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)** is a networking protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services.

**Problem:**    
Openly accessible LDAP servers can be abused for DDoS reflection attacks against third parties. Furthermore, they allow potential attackers to gather information on the server or network for preparation of further attacks.

**Verification:**    
In this section, we show how to check a host for an openly accessible service. All tests are performed using tools commonly included with standard Linux/Unix distributions. To verify the service is openly accessible from the Internet, the test should not be run on the host itself or the local network but instead from a different node on the Internet, for example a host on a cable/DSL line. In all examples, replace 000.000.00.00 with the IP address of the host to check.

To check if an LDAP server is openly accessible from the Internet, you can use the 'ldapsearch' tool:
```
$ ldapsearch -x -h 000.000.00.00 -s base
```

An openly accessible LDAP server will return information like this:
```console
dn:
currentTime: 20161227101121.0Z
subschemaSubentry: CN=Aggregate,CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=MYDOMAIN,DC=DE
dsServiceName: CN=NTDS Settings,CN=SRV01,CN=Servers,CN=Default-First-Site-Name,CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=MYDOMAIN,DC=DE
namingContexts: DC=MYDOMAIN,DC=de
namingContexts: CN=Configuration,DC=MYDOMAIN,DC=de
namingContexts: CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=MYDOMAIN,DC=de
defaultNamingContext: DC=MYDOMAIN,DC=de
schemaNamingContext: CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=MYDOMAIN,DC=de
configurationNamingContext: CN=Configuration,DC=MYDOMAIN,DC=de
rootDomainNamingContext: DC=MYDOMAIN,DC=de
```

Otherwise, ldapsearch will run into a timeout.

**Solution:**      
* Restrict access to the LDAP server to trusted clients, e. g. by blocking incoming connections to ports **389/tcp and 389/udp** on the firewall.   
* Use LDAP with StartTLS or LDAPS (LDAP over TLS/SSL) which provides secure and encrypted communication between clients and the LDAP server.

## Openly accessible Elasticsearch servers - port 9200  
---
**Defenition:**      
**Elasticsearch** is a popular search engine based on Apache Lucene, often used with web applications.

**Problem:**      
If an Elasticsearch server is openly accessible from the Internet and not protected by any forms of authentification, anyone who can connect to the server has unrestricted access to the data stored with it. This allows attackers to modify or delete any data or potentially steal sensitive information. In addition, prior to versions 1.2.x an attacker can use dynamic scripting to perform arbitrary code execution on the machine that Elasticsearch is hosted on.

**Verification:**      
In this section, we show how to check a host for an openly accessible service. All tests are performed using tools commonly included with standard Linux/Unix distributions. To verify the service is openly accessible from the Internet, the test should not be run on the host itself or the local network but instead from a different node on the Internet, for example a host on a cable/DSL line. In all examples, replace 000.000.00.00 with the IP address of the host to check.

To check if an Elasticsearch server is openly accessible from the Internet, you can use 'netcat' as follows:
```
$ printf "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n" | netcat 000.000.00.00 9200
```

An openly accessible Elasticsearch server will return information like this:
```console
{
  "status" : 200,
  "name" : "My Database",
  "cluster_name" : "My Cluster",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "1.7.5",
    "build_hash" : "00f95f4ffca6de89d68b7ccaf80d148f1f70e4d4",
    "build_timestamp" : "2016-02-02T09:55:30Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "4.10.4"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
```

Otherwise, netcat will return an error message:
```console
netcat: connect to 000.000.00.00 port 9200 (tcp) failed: Connection refused
```
or
```console
netcat: connect to 000.000.00.00 port 9200 (tcp) failed: Connection timed out
```

**Solution:**      
* Do not expose your Elasticsearch server to the Internet!  
* Restrict access to the Elasticsearch server to trusted systems (e. g., the web application server) in the server's configuration and/or by blocking incoming connections from the Internet to port **9200/tcp** on the firewall.  
* Check the [security best practices](<https://www.elastic.co/blog/scripting-security>) provided by the Elasticsearch developers.  
* Keep your Elasticsearch installation up-to-date. Install available security updates asap.

## Openly accessible Memcached servers - port 11211  
---
**Defenition:**      
**Memcached** is an open-source distributed memory object caching system which is generic in nature but often used for speeding up dynamic web applications. In the default configuration, memcached listens on port **11211/tcp** and (up to including version 1.5.5) also on port **11211/udp**.

**Problem:**    
memcached servers openly accessible from anywhere on the Internet via UDP are abused for DDoS reflection attacks against third parties on a regular basis. This way, extremely high amplification factors can be achieved which poses a serious security threat.

If a memcached server is openly accessible from the Internet via TCP or UDP and no SASL authentification has been configured, anyone who can connect to the server has unrestricted access to the data stored with it. This allows attackers to modify or delete any data or potentially steal sensitive information like login credentials for web applications or customer data from online shops.

**Verification:**    
In this section, we show how to check a host for an openly accessible service. All tests are performed using tools commonly included with standard Linux/Unix distributions. To verify the service is openly accessible from the Internet, the test should not be run on the host itself or the local network but instead from a different node on the Internet, for example a host on a cable/DSL line. In all examples, replace 000.000.00.00 with the IP address of the host to check.

**TCP**   
To check if a Memcached server is openly accessible from the Internet via TCP, you can use 'netcat' as follows:
```
$ echo "stats" | netcat 000.000.00.00 11211
```

An openly accessible Memcached server will return information like this:
```console
STAT pid 1090
STAT uptime 1808125
STAT time 1483622758
STAT version 1.4.14 (Ubuntu)
STAT libevent 2.0.21-stable
STAT pointer_size 64
STAT rusage_user 57.424253
STAT rusage_system 54.322505
STAT curr_connections 5
STAT total_connections 643
STAT connection_structures 9
STAT reserved_fds 20
```

Otherwise, netcat will return an error message:
```console
netcat: connect to 000.000.00.00 port 11211 (tcp) failed: Connection refused
```
or
```console
netcat: connect to 000.000.00.00 port 11211 (tcp) failed: Connection timed out
```

**UDP**     
To check if a Memcached server is openly accessible from the Internet via UDP, you can use 'netcat' as follows:
```
$ echo -en "\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00stats\r\n" | netcat -u 000.000.00.00 11211
```

An openly accessible Memcached server will return information like shown above.

**Solution:**       
* Do not expose your Memcached server to the Internet!   
* Restrict access to the Memcached server to trusted systems (e. g., the web application server) in the server's configuration and/or by blocking incoming connections from the Internet to ports **11211/tcp and 11211/udp** on the firewall.   
* The UDP port is usually not required. Start memcached with option **'-U 0'** to disable it.   
* Keep your Memcached installation up-to-date. Install available security updates asap.

## Openly accessible Redis servers - port 6379  
---
**Defenition:**      
**Redis** is an open-source in-memory database server with a simple key-value data structure often used with dynamic web applications.

**Problem:**    
If a Redis server is openly accessible from the Internet and no SASL authentification has been configured, anyone who can connect to the server has unrestricted access to the data stored with it. This allows attackers to modify or delete any data or potentially steal sensitive information like login credentials for web applications or customer data from online shops.

**Verification:**    
In this section, we show how to check a host for an openly accessible service. All tests are performed using tools commonly included with standard Linux/Unix distributions. To verify the service is openly accessible from the Internet, the test should not be run on the host itself or the local network but instead from a different node on the Internet, for example a host on a cable/DSL line. In all examples, replace 000.000.00.00 with the IP address of the host to check.

To check if a Redis server is openly accessible from the Internet, you can use 'netcat' as follows:
```
$ (printf "info\r\n"; sleep 1) | netcat 000.000.00.00 6379
```

An openly accessible Redis server will return information like this:
```console

```
or
```console
netcat: connect to 000.000.00.00 port 6379 (tcp) failed: Connection timed out
```

**Solution:**       
* Do not expose your Redis server to the Internet!   
* Restrict access to the Redis server to trusted systems (e. g., the web application server) in the server's configuration and/or by blocking incoming connections from the Internet to port **6379/tcp** on the firewall.

## Openly accessible MongoDB servers - port 27017  
---
**Defenition:**      
**MongoDB** is a popular NoSQL database system commonly used as a backend for web applications.

**Problem:**    
Access to a MongoDB server should be restricted to trusted systems. If a MongoDB server is openly accessible from the Internet, an attacker can take advantage of this to access the server and modify or delete data, or even obtain sensitive information like customer data from an online shop.

**Verification:**    
In this section, we show how to check a host for an openly accessible service. All tests are performed using tools commonly included with standard Linux/Unix distributions. To verify the service is openly accessible from the Internet, the test should not be run on the host itself or the local network but instead from a different node on the Internet, for example a host on a cable/DSL line. In all examples, replace 000.000.00.00 with the IP address of the host to check.

To check if a MongoDB server is openly accessible from the Internet, the MongoDB client tool 'mongo' can be used as follows:
```
$ mongo --host 000.000.00.00
```

If a connection to the MongoDB server was successfully established, the output looks like:
```console
MongoDB shell version: 2.4.10
connecting to: 000.000.00.00:27017/test
>
```

Otherwise the connection will run into a timeout:
```console
Fri Feb  5 10:25:42 Error: couldn't connect to server 000.000.00.00:27017 shell/mongo.js:86
exception: connect failed
```

**Solution:**     
* Do not expose your MongoDB server to the Internet!   
* Restrict access to the MongoDB server to trusted systems (e. g., the web application server) in the server's configuration and/or by blocking incoming connections from the Internet to port **27017/tcp** on the firewall.   
* Check the security best practices provided by the MongoDB developers.   
* Keep your MongoDB installation up-to-date. Install available security updates asap.

## Openly accessible Apache Cassandra NoSQL servers - ports 9042, 9160, 7000, 7001, 7199, 8888, 61620, 61621  
---
**Defenition:**      
**Apache Cassandra** is a free and open-source, distributed, wide column store, NoSQL database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure. Cassandra offers robust support for clusters spanning multiple datacenters, with asynchronous masterless replication allowing low latency operations for all clients.

**Problem:**    
Access to a Apache Cassandra NoSQL server should be restricted to trusted systems. Malicious users able to access internode communication and JMX ports can still:
* Craft internode messages to insert users into authentication schema
* Craft internode messages to truncate or drop schema
* Use tools such as sstableloader to overwrite system_auth tables
* Attach to the cluster directly to capture write traffic

**Verification:**    
In this section, we show how to check a host for an openly accessible service. All tests are performed using tools commonly included with standard Linux/Unix distributions. To verify the service is openly accessible from the Internet, the test should not be run on the host itself or the local network but instead from a different node on the Internet, for example a host on a cable/DSL line. In all examples, replace 000.000.00.00 with the IP address of the host to check.

To check if a Apache Cassandra NoSQL server is openly accessible from the Internet, the Apache Cassandra NoSQL client tool 'cqlsh' can be used as follows:
```
$ cqlsh --host 000.000.00.00
```

If a connection to the Apache Cassandra NoSQL server was successfully established, the output looks like:
```console
OUTPUT
Connected to Linuxize Cluster at 000.000.00.00:9042.
[cqlsh 5.0.1 | Cassandra 3.9 | CQL spec 3.4.2 | Native protocol v4]

cqlsh>
```

Otherwise the connection will run into a timeout:
```console
Fri Feb  5 10:25:42 Error: couldn't connect to server 000.000.00.00:9042 shell/cqlsh.js:86
exception: connect failed
```

**Solution:**       
* Do not expose your Apache Cassandra NoSQL server to the Internet!     
* Restrict access to the Apache Cassandra NoSQL server to trusted systems (e. g., the web application server) in the server's configuration and/or by blocking incoming connections from the Internet to next ports: **9042/tcp, 9160/tcp, 7000/tcp, 7001/tcp, 7199/tcp, 8888/tcp, 61620/tcp, 61621/tcp** on the firewall.   
* Check the security best practices provided by the Apache Cassandra NoSQL developers.

## Openly accessible Microsoft SQL-Server (MSSQL) browser services - ports 1433, 1434  
---
**Defenition:**      
**Microsoft SQL-Server (MSSQL)** includes a 'browser service' which lets users connect to instances of the database engine that are not listening on the default port, without knowing the port number.

**Problem:**    
In addition to disclosing information about the network the SQL-Server is running on (which can be used by potential attackers for preparation of further attacks), openly accessible MSSQL browser services can be abused for DDoS reflection attacks against third parties.

**Verification:**    
In this section, we show how to check a host for an openly accessible service. All tests are performed using tools commonly included with standard Linux/Unix distributions. To verify the service is openly accessible from the Internet, the test should not be run on the host itself or the local network but instead from a different node on the Internet, for example a host on a cable/DSL line. In all examples, replace 000.000.00.00 with the IP address of the host to check.

To check if an MSSQL browser service is openly accessible from the Internet, connect to the MS-SQL server using 'netcat' as follows:
```
$ netcat -u 000.000.00.00 1434
```

Then, press **<Ctrl+B>** followed by <Enter>.
An openly accessible MSSQL browser service will return a response like this:
```console
ServerName;S16362421;InstanceName;MSSQLSERVER2012;
IsClustered;No;Version;11.0.2100.60;tcp;49511;np;
\\S16462341\pipe\MSSQL$MSSQLSERVER2012\sql\query;;
```

Otherwise, there will be no response.

**Solution:**    
If the MSSQL browser service is not needed, disable it. Otherwise, restrict access to trusted clients, for example by blocking incoming connections to port **1434/udp** on the firewall.
Microsoft recommends:
*"The SQL Server Browser service lets users connect to instances of the Database Engine that are not listening on port 1433, without knowing the port number. To use SQL Server Browser, you must open UDP port 1434. To promote the most secure environment, leave the SQL Server Browser service stopped, and configure clients to connect using the port number."*

## Openly accessible Portmapper services - port 111   
---
**Defenition:**      
**The Portmapper (portmap, rpcbind)** is required for mapping RPC requests (remote procedure calls) to a network service. It is needed e. g. for mounting network shares using the Network File System (NFS).

**Problem:**    
Openly accessible Portmapper services can be abused for DDoS reflection attacks against third parties.

**Verification:**    
In this section, we show how to check a host for an openly accessible service. All tests are performed using tools commonly included with standard Linux/Unix distributions. To verify the service is openly accessible from the Internet, the test should not be run on the host itself or the local network but instead from a different node on the Internet, for example a host on a cable/DSL line. In all examples, replace 000.000.00.00 with the IP address of the host to check.

To check if a Portmapper service is openly accessible from the Internet, the tool 'rpcinfo' can be used:
```
$ rpcinfo -T udp -p 000.000.00.00
```

An openly accessible Portmapper service will return a response like this:
```console
program vers proto   port  service
100000    4   tcp    111  portmapper
100000    3   tcp    111  portmapper
100000    2   tcp    111  portmapper
100000    4   udp    111  portmapper
100000    3   udp    111  portmapper
100000    2   udp    111  portmapper
100024    1   udp  48035  status
100024    1   tcp  52605  status
```

Otherwise, rpcinfo will run into a timeout:
```console
rpcinfo: can't contact portmapper: RPC: Remote system error - Connection timed out
```

**Solution:**    
If the Portmapper service (portmap, rpcbind) is not required, disable or deinstall it. Otherwise, restrict access to trusted clients, for example by blocking incoming connections to port **111/tcp and 111/udp** on the firewall.

On Debian/Ubuntu based Linux systems, the portmapper service can be removed using the following command:
```
# apt-get remove rpcbind
```

## Openly accessible Sphinx servers - ports 9306, 9312  
---
**Defenition:**      
**Sphinx** is an open-source search server commonly used as a backend for web applications.

**Problem:**    
In the default configuration, the Sphinx server listens on ports **9306/tcp and 9312/tcp** on all network interfaces. Sphinx does not provide any authentication mechanisms. If a Sphinx server is openly accessible from the Internet, an attacker can take advantage of this to read, modify or delete any data stored in the Sphinx database.

**Verification:**    
In this section, we show how to check a host for an openly accessible service. All tests are performed using tools commonly included with standard Linux/Unix distributions. To verify the service is openly accessible from the Internet, the test should not be run on the host itself or the local network but instead from a different node on the Internet, for example a host on a cable/DSL line. In all examples, replace 000.000.00.00 with the IP address of the host to check.

To check if a Sphinx server is openly accessible from the Internet, you can use 'netcat' as follows:
```
$ netcat 000.000.00.00 9306
```

If a connection to the Sphinx server was successfully established, it will return the version information:
```console
2.2.11-id64-release (95ae9a)
```

**Solution:**     
* Do not expose your Sphinx server to the Internet!   
* Restrict access to the Sphinx server to trusted systems, e. g. by blocking incoming connections from the Internet to ports **9306/tcp and 9312/tcp** on the firewall.    
* If both the Web and Sphinx servers are running on the same system, the Sphinx server should only listen on the localhost interface. To achieve this, change the following lines in the configuration file    
```
listen       = 9312
listen       = 9306:mysql41
```
to:
```
listen       = localhost:9312
listen       = localhost:9306:mysql41
```
* Keep your Sphinx installation up-to-date. Install available security updates asap.

## Openly accessible Ubiquiti Device Discovery services - port 10001  
---
**Defenition:**      
**Ubiquiti network devices** come with a 'Device Discovery' service which is enabled by default and listening on port **10001/udp**.

**Problem:**    
Ubiquiti Device Discovery services openly accessible from the Internet disclose potentially sensitive information about the network device running the service and can be abused for performing DDoS reflection/amplification attacks against third parties.

**Verification:**    
In this section, we show how to check a host for an openly accessible service. All tests are performed using tools commonly included with standard Linux/Unix distributions. To verify the service is openly accessible from the Internet, the test should not be run on the host itself or the local network but instead from a different node on the Internet, for example a host on a cable/DSL line. In all examples, replace 000.000.00.00 with the IP address of the host to check.

To check if a Ubiquiti Device Discovery service is openly accessible from the Internet, you can use 'netcat' as follows:
```
$ echo -ne "\x01\x00\x00\x00" | netcat -u 000.000.00.00 10001 | hexdump -C
```

An openly accessible Device Discovery service will return information like this:
```console

## Openly accessible NetBIOS name services - ports 135, 137, 138, 139, 445  
---
**Defenition:**      
**NetBIOS** defines a software interface and a naming convention. NetBIOS-over-TCP/IP provides the NetBIOS programming interface over the TCP/IP protocol. NetBIOS includes a name service, often called WINS on Microsoft Windows operating systems. The NetBIOS name service uses port **137/udp**.

The NetBIOS name service is only needed within local networks and with systems before Microsoft Windows 2000 which require name resolution through WINS. Otherwise,in particular on the Internet, name resolution is done via DNS. Thus, it does not make sense to expose a NetBIOS name service to the Internet.

**Problem:**    
Openly accessible NetBIOS name services can be abused for DDoS reflection attacks against third parties. Furthermore, they allow potential attackers to gather information on the server or network for preparation of further attacks.

**Verification:**    
In this section, we show how to check a host for an openly accessible service. All tests are performed using tools commonly included with standard Linux/Unix distributions. To verify the service is openly accessible from the Internet, the test should not be run on the host itself or the local network but instead from a different node on the Internet, for example a host on a cable/DSL line. In all examples, replace 000.000.00.00 with the IP address of the host to check.

To check if a NetBIOS name service is openly accessible from the Internet, you can use the 'nmblookup' tool:
```
$ nmblookup -A 000.000.00.00
```

An openly accessible NetBIOS name service will return information like this:
```console
Looking up status of 000.000.00.00
        HOSTNAME        <00> -         B <ACTIVE>
        WORKGROUP       <00> - <GROUP> B <ACTIVE>
        HOSTNAME        <20> -         B <ACTIVE>
        WORKGROUP       <1e> - <GROUP> B <ACTIVE>
        MAC Address = 12-34-56-78-90-AB
```

Otherwise, nmblookup will run into a timeout:
```console
Looking up status of 000.000.00.00
No reply from 000.000.00.00
```

**Solution:**    
If NetBIOS-over-TCP/IP is not needed, disable it. Otherwise, restrict access to the NetBIOS name service to trusted clients, e. g. by blocking incoming connections to port **137 tcp/udp** on the firewall. For security reasons, you should consider blocking access to ports **135, 138, 139 and 445** from anywhere on the Internet as well.

On Linux/Unix systems, the NetBIOS name service is usually provided by 'nmbd' included with Samba. If you don't need Samba, disable or deinstall it. Otherwise, NetBIOS support can be disabled by setting `disable netbios = Yes` in the Samba configuration.
